	This is a demonstration of three dimensional fractals generated in processing.
	Traditionally, we see two dimensional representations of fractals but not nearly as many explorable three dimensional forms.
	With advances in graphics processing technology and VR increasing in prevalence I think itâ€™s worthwhile to investigate interesting three dimensional aesthetics that the user can navigate or interact with in some way.
